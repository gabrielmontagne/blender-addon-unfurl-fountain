= blender addon unfurl fountain

A minimalist repurposing of https://github.com/tin2tin[tin2tin]'s https://github.com/tin2tin/Blender_Screenwriter[ `text.scenes_to_strips` operator ]

Creates text scripts for all scenes, dialogues and actions from a fountain file.
To use, click on the `Unfurl fountain to strips` button on the text editor for a fountain file.

Works nicely with the https://github.com/tin2tin/Blender_Screenwriter/blob/master/README.md[Screenwriter] addon, for writing,
, as well as with the Power Sequencer, for nesting strips into new scenes. https://www.gdquest.com/docs/power-sequencer#power_sequencer.scene_create_from_selection[Power Sequencer]

My workflow is: write in Screenwriter + external editors, create the text strips using this addon, stretch and move things around, then, when you're ready, select strips from a scene and `Create Scene from Selection` to start doing basic layout and GP sketches.

The Fountain screenplay format is by Nima Yousefi & John August; original code for Objective-C at https://github.com/nyousefi/Fountain. It is ported to Python 3 by Colton J. Provias, improved by Manuel Senfft https://github.com/Tagirijus/fountain.
